%h2 Target Pi on Mac
%p So even the idea is to run software on the Pi, not everyone has a Pi (yet :-)
%p Others, like me, prefer to develop on a laptop and not carry the Pi around.
%p For all those, this here explains how to emulate the Pi on a Mac.
%p
  Even if you have a Pi,
  =link_to "this explains",  "remote_pi.html"
  a nice way to develop with it.

%h3 Qemu
%p Get the Qemu. There may be other emulators out there, and i have read of armulator, but this is what i found discribed and it works and is “easy enough”.
%pre
  %code
    :preserve
      brew install qemu

%h3 Pi images

%p Create a directory for the stuff on your mac, ie pi.
%p Get the latest Raspian image.
%p
  There seems to be some chicken and egg problem, so qemu needs the kernel separately.
  There is one in the links.

%h3 Configure

%p
  In the blog post there is some fun configuration, I did it and it works.
  Not sure what happens if you don’t.
  The booting is described below (you may or may not need an extra init=/bin/bash in the root… quotes),
  so boot your Pi and then configure:
%p
  %pre
    %code
      nano /etc/ld.so.preload
%p Put a # in front of the first to comment it out. Should just be one line there.
%p Press ctrl-x then y then enter to save and exit.
%p (Optional) Create a file /etc/udev/rules.d/90-qemu.rules with the following content:
%pre
  %code
    :preserve
      KERNEL=="sda", SYMLINK+="mmcblk0"
      KERNEL=="sda?", SYMLINK+="mmcblk0p%n"
      KERNEL=="sda2", SYMLINK+="root"
%p
  The kernel sees the disk as /dev/sda, while a real pi sees /dev/mmcblk0.
  This will create symlinks to be more consistent with the real pi.
%h3#boot Boot
%p There is quite a bit to the command line to boot the pi (i have an alias), here it is:
%pre
  %code
    :preserve
      qemu-system-arm -kernel kernel-qemu -cpu arm1176 -m 256 -M versatilepb -no-reboot -serial stdio -append 'root=/dev/sda2 panic=1 rootfstype=ext4 rw' -hda raspbian.img -redir tcp:2222::22
%ul
  %li the cpu is what broadcom specifies, ok
  %li memory is unfortunately hardcoded in the versatilepb “machine”
  %li the kernel is the file name of the kernel you downloaded (or extracted)
  %li raspbian.img is the image you downloaded. Renamed as it probably had the datestamp on it
  %li the redir redircts the port 2222 to let you log into the pi
%p So
%pre
  %code
    :preserve
      ssh -p 2222 -l pi localhost
%p will get you “in”. Ie username pi (password raspberry is the default) and port 2222
%p Qemu bridges the network (that it emulates), and so your pi is now as connected as your mac.
%h3#more-disk More Disk
%p The image that you download has only 200Mb free. Since the gcc is included and we’re developing (tiny little files of) ruby, this may be ok. If not there is a 3 step procedure to up the space.
%pre
  %code
    :preserve
      dd if=/dev/zero bs=1m count=2048 >> raspbian.img
%p The 2048 gets you 2Gb as we specified 1m (meg).
%p On the pi launch
%pre
  %code
    :preserve
      sudo fdisk /dev/sda
%p This will probably only work if your do the (Optional) config above.
%p
  Say p, and write down the start of the second partition (122880 for me).
  d 2 will delete the second partition
  n p 2 will create a new primary second partition
  write the number as start and just return to the end.
  p to check
  w to write and quit.
%p Reboot, and run
%pre
  %code
    :preserve
      resize2fs
