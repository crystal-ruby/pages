  title: How to use a remote pi
  —
%h3#headless Headless
%p The pi is a strange mix, development board and full pc in one. Some people use it as a pc, but not me.
%p I use the pi because it is the same price as an Arduino, but much more powerful.
%p As such i don’t use the keyboard or display and that is called headless mode, logging in with ssh.
%pre
  %code
    :preserve
      ssh -p 2222 -l pi localhost
%p the -p 2222 is only needed for the qemu version, not the real pi.
%h3#authorized Authorized
%p
  Over ssh one can use many other tools, but the password soon gets to be a pain.
  So the first thing i do is copy my public key over to the pi. This will allow login without password.
%pre
  %code
    :preserve
      scp -P 2222 .ssh/id_rsa.pub pi@localhost:.ssh/authorized_keys
%p
  This assumes a fresh pi, otherwise you have to append your key to the authorized ones. Also if it complains about no
  id_rsa.pub then you have to generate a key pair (public/private) using ssh-keygen (no password, otherwise you’ll be typing that)
%h3#syncing Syncing
%p
  Off course I do all that to be able to actually work on my machine. On the Pi my keyboard doesn’t even work and
  i’d have to use emacs or nano instead of TextMate. So i need to get the files accross.
  For this there is a million ways, but since i just go one way (mac to pi) i use rsync (over ssh).
%p I set up a directory (home) in my pi directory (on the mac), that i copy to the home directory on the pi using:
%pre
  %code
    :preserve
      rsync -r -a -v -e "ssh -l pi -p 2222" ~/pi/home/ localhost:/home/pi
%p The pi/home is on my laptop and the command transfers all files to /home/pi , the default directory of the pi user.
%h3#automatic-sync Automatic sync
%p Transferring files is off course nice, but having to do it by hand after saving quickly becomes tedious.
%p Fswatch to the rescue. It will watch the filesystem (fs) for changes. Install with brew install fswatch
%p
  Then you can store the above rsync command in a shell script, say sync.sh.
  Add afplay “/System/Library/Sounds/Morse.aiff” if you like to know it worked.
%p Then just run
%pre
  %code
    :preserve
      fswatch ~/pi/home/ sync.sh
%p And hear the ping each time you save.
%h2#conclusion Conclusion
%p So the total setup involves the qemu set up as described. To work i
%ul
  %li start the terminal (iterm)
  %li start the pi, with my alias “pi” *
  %li log in to the pi in it’s window
  %li open textmate with the directory i work (within the home)
  %li
    %p edit, save, wait for ping, alt-tab to pi window, run my whatever and repeat until it’s time for tea
  %li (i don’t log into the prompt it gives in item so as not to accidentally quit the qemu session with ctr-c )
