%h2 Top level Class and methods
%p The top level declarations in a file may only be class definitions
%pre
  %code
    :preserve
      class Dictionary < Object
        int add(Object o)
          ... statements
        end
      end
%p
  The class hierarchy is explained in
  = succeed "," do
    %a{:href => "parfait.html"} here
%p
  Methods must be typed, both arguments and return. Generally class names serve as types, but “int” can
  be used as a shortcut for Integer.
%p
  Code may not be outside method definitions, like in ruby. A compiled program starts at the builtin
  method
  = succeed "," do
    %strong init
  %strong Space.main
%p
  Classes are represented by class objects (instances of class Class to be precise) and methods by
  Method objects, so all information is available at runtime.
%h2 Expressions
%p
  Soml distinguishes between expressions and statements. Expressions have value, statements perform an
  action. Both are compiled to Register level instructions for the current method. Generally speaking
  expressions store their value in a register and statements store those values elsewhere, possibly
  after operating on them.
%p The subsections below correspond roughly to the parsers rule names.
%p
  %strong Basic expressions
  are numbers (integer or float), strings or names, either variable, argument,
  field or class names. (normal details applicable). Special names include self (the current
  receiver), and message (the currently executed method frame). These all resolve to a register
  with contents.
%pre
  %code
    :preserve
        23
        "hi there"
        argument_name
        Object
%p
  A
  %strong field access
  resolves to the fields value at the time. Fields must be defined by
  field definitions, and are basically instance variables, but not hidden (see below).
  The example below shows how to define local variables at the same time. Notice chaining, both for
  field access and call, is not allowed.
%pre
  %code
    :preserve
        Type l = self.type
        Class  c = l.object_class
        Word   n = c.name
%p
  A
  %strong Call expression
  is a method call that resolves to the methods return value. If no receiver is
  specified, self (the current receiver) is used. The receiver may be any of the basic expressions
  above, so also class instances. The receiver type is known at compile time, as are all argument
  types, so the class of the receiver is searched for a matching method. Many methods of the same
  name may exist, but to issue a call, an exact match for the arguments must be found.
%pre
  %code
    :preserve
        Class c = self.get_class()
        c.get_super_class()
%p
  An
  %strong operator expression
  is a binary expression, with either of the other expressions as left
  and right operand, and an operator symbol between them. Operand types must be integer.
  The symbols allowed are normal arithmetic and logical operations.
%pre
  %code
    :preserve
         a + b
         counter | 255
         mask >> shift
%p
  Operator expressions may be used in assignments and conditions, but not in calls, where the result
  would have to be assigned beforehand. This is one of those cases where soml’s low level approach
  shines through, as soml has no auto-generated temporary variables.
%h2 Statements
%p
  We have seen the top level statements above. In methods the most interesting statements relate to
  flow control and specifically how conditionals are expressed. This differs somewhat from other
  languages, in that the condition is expressed explicitly (not implicitly like in c or ruby).
  This lets the programmer express more precisely what is tested, and also opens an extensible
  framework for more tests than available in other languages. Specifically overflow may be tested in
  soml, without dropping down to assembler.
%p
  An
  %strong if statement
  is started with the keyword if_ and then contains the branch type. The branch
  type may be
  = succeed "." do
    %em plus, minus, zero, nonzero or overflow
  %em If
  may be continued with en
  = succeed "," do
    %em else
  %em end
%pre
  %code
    :preserve
        if_zero(a - 5)
          ....
        else
          ....
        end
%p
  A
  %strong while statement
  is very much like an if, with off course the normal loop semantics, and
  without the possible else.
%pre
  %code
    :preserve
        while_plus( counter )
          ....
        end
%p
  A
  %strong return statement
  return a value from the current functions. There are no void functions.
%pre
  %code
    :preserve
      return 5
%p
  A
  %strong field definition
  is to declare an instance variable on an object. It starts with the keyword
  field, must be in class (not method) scope and may not be assigned to.
%pre
  %code
    :preserve
      class Class < Object
        field List instance_methods
        field Type object_type
        field Word name
        ...
      end
%p
  A
  %strong local variable definition
  declares, and possibly assigns to, a local variable. Local variables
  are stored in frame objects, in fact they are instance variables of the current frame object.
  When resolving a name, the compiler checks argument names first, and then local variables.
%pre
  %code
    :preserve
      int counter = 0
%p
  Any of the expressions may be assigned to the variable at the time of definition. After a variable is
  defined it may be assigned to with an
  %strong assignment statement
  any number of times. The assignment
  is like an assignment during definition, without the leading type.
%pre
  %code
    :preserve
        counter = 0
%p Any of the expressions, basic, call, operator, field access, may be assigned.
%h2 Code generation and scope
%p
  Compiling generates two results simultaneously. The more obvious is code for a function, but also an
  object structure of classes etc that capture the declarations. To understand the code part better
  the register abstraction should be studied, and to understand the object structure the runtime.
%p
  The register machine abstraction is very simple, and so is the code generation, in favour of a simple
  model. Especially in the area of register assignment, there is no magic and only a few simple rules.
%p
  The main one of those concerns main memory access ordering and states that object memory must
  be consistent at the end of the statement. Since there is only only object memory in soml, this
  concerns all assignments, since all variables are either named or indexed members of objects.
  Also local variables are just members of the frame.
%p
  This obviously does leave room for optimisations as preliminary benchmarks show. But benchmarks also
  show that it is not such a bit issue and much more benefit can be achieved by inlining.
