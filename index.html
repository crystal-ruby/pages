    <p>
      Salama is maybe the first successful attempt at writing a virtual machine without the use
      of c or c tools.
      It defines and implements an object virtual machine completely in object oriented terms,
      using ruby to bootstrap itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just some of the features, most of which would not be possible in c:
      <ul>
        <li> Linked-List, not stack, based </li>
        <li> Multiple return addresses based on type  </li>
        <li> Multiple implementations per function based on type  </li>
        <li> Implicit type tracking using adaptive code</li>
        <li> Explicit <a href="/2015/06/20/the-static-call-chain.html">message and frame objects</a></li>
        <li> <a href="http://book.salama-vm.org/register/machine.html">Register machine abstraction</a></li>
        <li> <a href="http://book.salama-vm.org/object/instructions.html">Extensible</a> instruction set</li>
      </ul>
			Salama defines is's own machine language (soml) to bridge the gap between the higher language
			(ruby) and assembler. Both soml and assembler can be seens as layers towards the final
			 binary executables</li>

    <h2 class="center">Status</h2>
    <p>
      While the project is just getting on two years, it is starting to settle conceptually,
      progress smoothly, and produce <b>working binaries</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In numbers, there are over <b>1000 commits</b>, 6 sub-projects, more than 10k lines of code
      and well over 600 tests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maybe more importantly there is <a href"/book.html">good documentation</a> along with an
      evolved idea of how most of the difficult issues are solved. So while the executables are
      still of the "Hello world" quality, there are no coneptual problems anymore.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is also an interpreter (mostly for testing) and a basic
      <a href="https://github.com/salama/salama-debugger"> visual debugger</a> which not only helps
      debugging, but also understanding of the machine.

    <p>
      The short introduction is under the <a href="/salama/layers.html">architecture</a> menu.
    </p>
    <p>
      The full documentation is in form of a gitbook and can be <a href="/book.html">viewed</a> ,
      and  <a href="https://github.com/salama/object-machine">edited</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The <a href="/project/motivation.html">about</a> section has some info of when and how this
      started. If you feel like contributing <a href="/contribute.html">read this</a> or write a
			<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/salama-dev"> mail </a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Last but not least, i try to get recent developments down on paper when they are still
      fresh, which you can read in the <a href="{{ site.posts.first.url }}">news</a> section.
