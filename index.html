    <h2 class="center">Goal</h2>
		<p>
			The goal is to execute (not interpret) object oriented code without external dependencies, on modern hardware.
    </p>
		<p>
			This means compiling dynamic code into binary. Using several intermediate representations it
			is possible to keep track of type changes and switch between differently typed, but
			logically equivalent, versions of methods.

			As the system is 100% in ruby, the ultimate goal is to carry on the compilation at run-time,
			ie after the program has started.

			<b>No interpretation.</b>
    </p>
		<p>
			Using the compilation method on it's own runtime (and bootstraping with an exising ruby),
			it is possible to write the whole system in a dynamic oo language (ruby), thus
			<b>removing the two language problem</b> (having to choose between nice and fast)
    </p>

		<p>
			Work is progressing on the ruby compiler. This uses a pure
			<a href="https://github.com/whitequark/parser"> ruby parser</a> to create:
			<ul>
				<li> An Object model of  <a href="/typed/parfait.html">classes, types</a>, methods and basic types </li>
				<li> Several strongly typed method versions for every ruby instance method </li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			The lower level, strongly typed layer is  <a href="/typed/typed.html">finished.</a>.
			While it has well known typed language data semantics, it introduces several new concept:
			<ul>
				<li> Object based memory (no global memory) </li>
				<li> Multiple return addresses based on type  </li>
				<li> Multiple implementations per function based on type  </li>
				<li> Explicit <a href="/2015/06/20/the-static-call-chain.html">message and frame objects</a>(no stack)</li>
				<li> <a href="https://github.com/salama/salama/tree/master/lib/register" target="_blank">Register machine abstraction</a></li>
				<li> Extensible instruction set, with arm implementations
			</ul>
		</p>
    <p>
			An abstract risc like register level defines some abstraction from the actual hardware. The
			type compiler compiles to this level, but a mapping to Arm is provided to produce <b>working binaries</b>.
    </p>
		<p>
      There is also an interpreter (mostly for testing) and a basic
      <a href="https://github.com/salama/salama-debugger"> visual debugger</a> which not only helps
      debugging, but also understanding of the machine.
